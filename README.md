I'm a data scientist who is passionate about learning and teaching others. When I'm not coding you can find me trail running, cooking or playing Go.</p>

### 💼 Where I Work

[Interlate](https://www.interlate.com/): Senior Data Scientist

### ✏️ Left School With

PhD in Chemical Engineering and Grad Certificate in Applied Finance and Investment

### 💻 Currently Working On

* [DataCamp - R Programmer Track](https://www.datacamp.com/join-me/NTU5MTAwMg==) 
* [Coursera - Cloud Computing Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing-foundations-duke/)
* [edX Stanford Online - Statistical Learning](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+STATSX0001+1T2020/home)

* Building data visualisation and models with Tidymodels, Modeltime and Tidyverse. Every Tuesday I check out the latest data posted via the TidyTuesday package.

### 📚 Currently Learning More About:

* Bayesian statistics with Python, with the second edition of the book [Think Bayes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/149208946X/).

### 💡 Future Learning Plans:

Since there are too many things to learn at once...

* [Practical Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science), learning how to combine my machine learning knowledge with AWS. 

* [Supply chain optimization](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/3110673916/) through simulation. I don't work in supply chain but enjoy solving "real world" problems with simulations. 

* [Machine Learning Engineering for Production MLOps Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops).

* Julia language with an [MIT course](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). 

* [Discrete Optimization Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization).

* [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/).

* Having a look at the Friday challenges at [538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)

### Books On My To Read List

* [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919). 

### 💬 Ask Me About:

* Machine learning modeling with Tidymodels and Shiny dashboards.
